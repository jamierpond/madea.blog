# madea.blog

A free, open-source service that automatically turns your GitHub repo into a beautiful blog.

## How It Works

1. Create a public GitHub repository (any name works, but `blog` or `madea-blog` are recommended)
2. Add markdown files to your repo
3. Visit `username.madea.blog`
4. Your blog is live!

## Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Just write markdown and push to GitHub
- **Automatic Updates**: Your blog updates whenever you push to your repo
- **Free Forever**: This is an open-source gift to the community
- **GitHub-Powered**: Uses the GitHub API to fetch and render your content
- **Simple**: No build steps, no deployment, no hassle

## Writing Posts

Just create markdown files in your repository. That's it.

```markdown
# My First Post

This is my blog post content...
```

## Example

Check out the sample posts in this repository:
- `turtle-dog-safety.md` - Protecting your canine from shelled menaces
- `sea-beast-dinner-etiquette.md` - Hosting tips for unexpected aquatic guests
- `raccoon-negotiations.md` - Advanced diplomacy with trash pandas
- `haunted-appliances.md` - Living with possessed household items
- `explaining-internet-to-time-travelers.md` - Bridging the temporal knowledge gap

## Why "madea"?

Because blogs should be as straightforward as Madea herself - no nonsense, no complexity, just getting it done.
