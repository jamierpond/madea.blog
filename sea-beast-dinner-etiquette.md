# What to Do When the Beast Emerges from the Sea But You Didn't Set a Place for Him at the Table for Supper

We've all been there. You're sitting down to a nice family dinner - pot roast, mashed potatoes, green beans - when suddenly the ancient beast rises from the depths, dripping with brine and cosmic horror, and you realize with mounting dread that you only set six places at the table.

## The Social Faux Pas of the Century

Not setting a place for an eldritch sea creature is perhaps the most embarrassing hosting mistake you can make. Your mother warned you about this. Your grandmother's grandmother warned you about this. But did you listen? No.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: The TV Tray Gambit

Pull out a TV tray and act like it was totally intentional. "Oh, Beast? We thought you'd be more comfortable here by the window where you can see the ocean!" Bold strategy. Might work if the Beast is in a good mood (it never is).

### Option 2: The Musical Chairs Approach

Quickly suggest that everyone eat standing up. "It's very European," you'll say, as tentacles slither across your hardwood floors. Nobody will believe you, but at least you tried.

### Option 3: Give Up Your Seat

The honorable route. Offer the Beast your own chair and eat in the kitchen while making intense eye contact with your spouse who SWORE they checked the tide charts.

## Conversation Topics to Avoid

- How's the water? (Offensive)
- Any summer vacation plans? (The Beast does not vacation)
- Hot enough for you? (The Beast exists beyond temperature)
- Did you catch the game? (What game? The Beast knows only the eternal void)

## Safe Conversation Topics

- The weather (vague enough to be inoffensive)
- Real estate prices (everyone can relate)
- That new restaurant downtown (though the Beast will probably mention it's "not as good as the old place that sank in 1847")

## Dietary Restrictions

Ask politely if the Beast has any dietary restrictions. Most sea beasts are pescatarian, which is ironic when you think about it. Some are gluten-free. One or two are doing keto. Be accommodating.

## The Exit Strategy

Eventually, the Beast will leave. They always do. The sea calls to them, or they get bored of your small talk, or they remember they left something in the Mariana Trench. When they go, act casual. A simple "Thanks for coming" will suffice.

Do NOT say "Don't be a stranger!" because they will absolutely take you up on that.

## Prevention for Next Time

Keep an extra place setting ready at all times. Yes, it looks weird. Yes, your friends will ask about it. But the alternative is this exact scenario happening again, and frankly, your nerves can't take it.

The ocean is patient. The Beast is eternal. Your dinner parties need better planning.
